    <p> <i>“Humans are unique beings, so why do such distinct beings depend on common merchandise? <br> Choose uniqueness <br> Choose Checos”</i></p>
    <p>My name is Chehan Ranasinghe. I started this business as a teenager while following up my management degree in a private university.
       I’ve always dreamt of starting my own business and with time my mind showed me the way.
    <br> <br> Ever since I was a little boy, I’ve always shown talent and skill when it comes to delicate handmade items. My parents and grandma still remind me how I use leftover raw materials to make creative items.
     They have always supported me to pursue my dreams. Apart from making leather items, my skills include drawing, singing, dancing, acting and dubbing.
    <br> <br> I like to mention how I got into leathercraft. While in a conversation with my relative, he mentioned that his brother started to craft leather items, and he asked my opinion on it.
     If you think my opinion was very positive, you are wrong. My initial reaction was, "dude, don't even think about it! Look, we have to buy so much of tools, leather etc.
     It's too expensive too, there's no point of talking about it." My relative then recommended me to watch a single tutorial video of how it's made, and I watched it for the sake of watching it.
     But, believe me, after I watched the video, my mind started building dreams by dreams upon the foundation of curiosity. I started to learn with the determination achieving this dream.
      And that's what laid the foundation for this amazing journey.
    <br> <br> There are three concepts that I signify in my products, Classy, Compelling, and Sumptuous, which is why checos is also known as CCS. But why do I love these leather products so much?
    The rugged and natural look of it, the amazing smell and the smooth feel of it, the sound it makes when craft it, it's really a mind relaxing pill for me
    <br> <br> "Handmade items are expensive and I can buy this for half the price in the market", is a common thing I hear. But, are they actually made of "leather" or is it just rexine stitched over a piece of cardboard?
     Can they be customized? Are they unique? Does it have a long life? At Checos we assure you that they answer to all the above questions is YES!
    <br> <br> Thank you very much for visiting our little shop and I hope you enjoy our products and keep your trust in us to provide you products with a long-lasting quality.
    <br> <br> -Chehan Ranasinghe, founder Checos.  </p>
